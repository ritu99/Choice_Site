		<p> Over unit 2, we learned about adding a variety of features to our code, and improving our existing coding skills and knowledge. We talked more about the basics of coding HTML, and learned introductary CSS to prepare us for the next unit. These skills will come in handy throughout the year, and will benefit us for future units that we cover. </p>
