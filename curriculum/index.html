        <h1 class="text-center"> Biology Curriculum </h1>
        <h3> Course Description </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Biology is a class designed to teach students the basic biological processes and how they work and interact with each other.
            This course challenges students to critically think about and examine life in all of its form.
            Teachers in this course will use a variety of methods to teach students, including; lecture, group discussion, projects, labs, computer assignments, and other unique type of works.
          </p>
        <h3> Coursework </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Like much of Choice Academy, homework will be strictly optional, but extra credit will be given to each completed assignment.
            Work in the class will involve worksheets, occasional lectures, and many labs.
            Grading of labs will be based on following correct procedures and observing the scientific method first, while accuracy and correctness will be considered second.
            Worksheets will be, for the most part, completion, however it is expected that the material will be known for any examinations and labs.
          </p>
        <h3> Grading </h3>
          <h4> Quizzes (25% of total grade): </h4>
            <p class="description">
              Quizzes will be held every two weeks, and students are expected to review lectures and worksheets from class. Quizzes may be short answer or multiple choice.s
            </p>
          <h4> Worksheet (25% of total grade): </h4>
            <p class="description">
              Worksheets and daily work from the textbook will mostly be completion, but students will be responsible for fixing their errors.
              It is important that students complete their homework so that they do not fall behind.
            </p>
          <h4> Major Exams (50% of total grade) </h4>
            <p>
              Projects (both individual and group-based) will be counted as major evaluations, and will be graded based on quality, accuracy, and presentation. The grading criteria will help prepare the students for the real world, where they may be required to give a presentation in their workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              3/4 of questions in unit tests will be multiple choice, and 1/4 will be lab practicals, where the student will be tested on identification, procedure, and results from labs done in class. Students are expected to review everything learned from classwork and labs, and should be able to apply the concepts they learned to challenging questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Labs are group-based and will be graded based on the correct use of the scientific method and performance in the actual lab itself. Labs will be held once every other week, and students are expected to prepare beforehand by completing a preliminary write-up to test their understanding of the topic
            </p>
            <p>
              Labs are a critical part of the course as it allows for students to apply their knowledge that they learn in class. It also allows for students to gain a greater understanding of what they know. Labs also provide a more memorable and tactile experience with the material so that students will be able to retain the information for future use.
            </p>
        <h3> Topics </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>To fully understand the processes that allow for life to occur</li>
            <li>To understand the history of life itself and where life as we know it comes from</li>
            <li>To understand the chemistry behind cell processes in animals and plants</li>
          </ul>
        <h3> Subjects </h3>
          <ul>

        <h3> Textbooks </h3>
          <p class="description">
            In biology, textbooks will be sparingly used, except for supplement material.
            Digital textbooks are permitted within the class, but copies will be provided for students who prefer a physical copy.
          </p>
        <h3> Electronic Policy </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Biology follows the general Choice Academy policy, which states that electronics can be freely used during classes except on examination days.
            It is up to the student to use technology wisely, and is up to the students whether they deem it is necessary to use electronics or not.
            In the end, the students are responsible for making smart decisions in class in order to ensure their success.

        <h1 class="text-center"> Algebra II Curriculum </h1>
        <h3> Course Description </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Algebra II is a course designed to challenge students to critically think and determine how to solve difficult mathematical problems.
            Application problems will be kept to a minimum just so that students will see the basic applications of mathematics in everyday life,
            however since the majority of students won’t have to use trigonometry or find the intersection of functions
            those types of topics will be taught in a strictly mathematical sense so students can grasp the concepts and use them for when test day comes or to build on for other math classes.
            Teachers will first lecture students about how to solve certain problems with different processes, and then solve example problems along with them.
            Then, they will let students solve problems on their own based on the methods learned in lectures.
          </p>
        <h3> Coursework </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Work in the class will be done in the form of worksheets and textbook problems, and will be graded based on accuracy and work. Homework, on the other hand, is optional and will be graded for completion if done. Students are expected to practice problems went over in class to study for quizzes and tests.
