        <h3> Course Description </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Biology is a class designed to teach students the basic biological processes and how they work and interact with each other.
            This course challenges students to critically think about and examine life in all of its form.
            Teachers in this course will use a variety of methods to teach students, including; lecture, group discussion, projects, labs, computer assignments, and other unique type of works.
          </p>
        <h3> Coursework </h3>
          <p class="description">
            Like much of Choice Academy, homework will be strictly optional, but extra credit will be given to each completed assignment.
            Work in the class will involve worksheets, occasional lectures, and many labs.
            Grading of labs will be based on following correct procedures and observing the scientific method first, while accuracy and correctness will be considered second.
            Worksheets will be, for the most part, completion, however it is expected that the material will be known for any examinations and labs.
          </p>
        <h3> Grading </h3>
          <h4> Labs (1/3 of total grade): </h4>
            <p class="description">
              Labs are group-based and will be graded based on the correct use of the scientific method and performance in the actual lab itself.
            </p>
          <h4> Worksheet (1/3 of total grade): </h4>
            <p class="description">
              Worksheets and daily work from the textbook will mostly be completion, but students will be responsible for fixing errors. Homework is optional, and will be graded for completion if done.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              Quizzes will be held every two weeks, and students are expected to review lectures and worksheets from class. Quizzes may be short answer or multiple choice.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              Projects (both individual and group-based) will be counted as daily work, and will be graded based on participation and accuracy.
            </p>
          <h4> Major Exams (1/3 of total grade) </h4>
            <p class="description">
              3/4 of questions in unit tests will be multiple choice, and 1/4 will be lab practicals, where the student will be tested on identification, procedure, and results from labs done in class. Students are expected to review everything learned from classwork and labs, and should be able to apply the concepts they learned to challenging questions.
            </p>
